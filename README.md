**Use this case to wire GLM-5.2 into Cursor through Fireworks with a minimal OpenAI-compatible setup and no custom client code.**

Skirano shows a minimal Cursor setup flow: paste a Fireworks key into the OpenAI API key field, use `https://api.fireworks.ai/inference/v1` as the base URL, select `accounts/fireworks/models/glm-5p2`, and restart Cursor. That makes this a concrete route for trying GLM-5.2 inside a familiar coding IDE.

**Use this case to route GLM-5.2 coding-plan traffic to the coding-optimized Z.ai endpoint instead of the generic API path.**

The post points users to `https://api.z.ai/api/coding/paas/v4` instead of the general `https://api.z.ai/api/paas/v4/` endpoint for coding-plan workloads, and notes that `https://api.z.ai/api/anthropic` is what tools like Claude Code and OpenCode usually use where supported.
